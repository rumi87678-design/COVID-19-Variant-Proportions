# COVID-19-Variant-Proportions
The project is a Server-Side Rendered (SSR) COVID-19 Variant Tracker designed for Bangladesh, built using the Python Flask web framework


A responsive dashboard visualizing COVID-19 variant distribution and genomic surveillance data in Bangladesh. 

This is a static HTML/CSS prototype for a COVID-19 variant tracker dashboard designed for Bangladesh. It's a front-end design mockup that visualizes example data with a focus on a clean layout and Bengali language interface. 


Simply open `variant_tracker.html` or  `pie_chart.html ` in any browser to view it—no server, frameworks, or installation required. The project is currently a visual concept, not a connected application with real-time data.
